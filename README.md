I started this collection in July 2015, maybe I'll get back to adding code for older posts here at some point, maybe not.

Github doesn't allow downloading project subfolders. I've tried to keep the structure flat, so you can either try downloading the individual files you need, or try one of the approaches people have developed for downloading folders. See this [stackoverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7106012/download-a-single-folder-or-directory-from-a-github-repo/38879691#38879691). 

[DownGit](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home) worked for me in Chrome, but not Safari.
